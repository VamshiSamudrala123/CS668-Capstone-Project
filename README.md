#Lung Cancer

### Project Overview
This project aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of lung and colon cancer diagnosis using deep learning models on histopathological images. Histopathological analysis, involving the microscopic examination of tissue samples, is critical in identifying cancerous cells. By developing a robust classification model, this project seeks to support pathologists in clinical settings.

### Research Questions
1. Can a deep learning model accurately classify lung and colon cancer histopathological images into categories (e.g., colon adenocarcinoma, benign colonic tissue, lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, benign lung tissue)?
2. Can this model be integrated into clinical workflows to assist pathologists in diagnostic tasks?

### Dataset: LC25000
- Origin: Developed by researchers at the University of California, Irvine.
- Description: The LC25000 is a large-scale histopathological dataset with 25,000 color images of lung and colon tissues, organized into five classes: colon adenocarcinoma, benign colonic tissue, lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, and benign lung tissue, with 5,000 images per class.
- Image Resolution: Each image has a resolution of 768x768 pixels.

### Motivation
- Technical Motivation: To advance computer vision in medical image analysis and leverage data-driven approaches for diagnostic support.
- Personal Motivation: To make a meaningful impact on healthcare and advance in a data science career focused on medical applications.
