Lung and Colon Cancer Diagnosis with Deep Learning

This project focuses on improving how we diagnose lung and colon cancer by using deep learning models to analyze histopathological images—essentially, detailed images of tissue samples. Examining these images under a microscope is a standard approach for identifying cancer cells, but it can be time-consuming and challenging. By creating a reliable classification model, this project aims to give pathologists a powerful tool to make diagnosis faster and more accurate in clinical settings.

### Key Research Questions
1. Can a deep learning model distinguish between various types of lung and colon tissues, including:
   - Colon adenocarcinoma
   - Normal (benign) colon tissue
   - Lung adenocarcinoma
   - Lung squamous cell carcinoma
   - Normal (benign) lung tissue?

2. Is it feasible to integrate this model into clinical workflows to assist pathologists and enhance diagnostic accuracy?

### About the Dataset: LC25000
- **Source**: The dataset, developed by researchers at the University of California, Irvine, provides a large number of tissue images to support cancer research.
- **Description**: LC25000 includes 25,000 high-resolution color images of lung and colon tissue samples. The images are grouped into five categories: colon adenocarcinoma, benign colon tissue, lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, and benign lung tissue, with 5,000 images for each class.
- **Resolution**: Each image has a resolution of 768x768 pixels, ensuring enough detail for accurate model training.
- **Access**: You can find the dataset [https://academictorrents.com/details/5d7d4b76380c47168027f6e2d58aa6d2fefb08b1](https://academictorrents.com/details/7a638ed187a6180fd6e464b3666a6ea0499af4af).

### Motivation
- **Technical Drive**: This project is an opportunity to explore the potential of computer vision for medical image analysis. The goal is to harness deep learning to support diagnostic work, pushing forward what’s possible with data-driven healthcare solutions.
- **Personal Drive**: Cancer diagnosis can be life-changing. Helping to create tools that improve early and accurate detection would be incredibly rewarding, and it aligns with my long-term goal of using data science in impactful ways within the medical field.
