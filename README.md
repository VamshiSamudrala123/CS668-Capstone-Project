Lung and Colon Cancer Diagnosis Using Deep Learning on Histopathological Images

This project aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of lung and colon cancer diagnosis through deep learning models applied to histopathological images. Histopathological analysis, which involves the microscopic examination of tissue samples, is crucial for identifying cancerous cells. By developing a robust classification model, this project seeks to support pathologists in clinical settings, enabling faster and more accurate diagnoses.

### Research Questions
1. Can a deep learning model accurately classify lung and colon cancer histopathological images into categories such as:
   - Colon adenocarcinoma
   - Benign colonic tissue
   - Lung adenocarcinoma
   - Lung squamous cell carcinoma
   - Benign lung tissue?
   
2. Can this model be effectively integrated into clinical workflows to assist pathologists in diagnostic tasks?

### Dataset: LC25000
- **Origin**: Developed by researchers at the University of California, Irvine.
- **Description**: The LC25000 dataset contains 25,000 high-quality color images of lung and colon tissues, categorized into five classes:
  - Colon adenocarcinoma
  - Benign colonic tissue
  - Lung adenocarcinoma
  - Lung squamous cell carcinoma
  - Benign lung tissue
- **Image Resolution**: Each image has a resolution of 768x768 pixels, providing sufficient detail for model training and validation.
